This guide will help you create a TODO***. 
 
## You will learn
- What?
- Why?
- How?
- Where?
- When?


## Resources/URLs/Entities Overview

In this guide, we will create three services using proper URIs and HTTP methods:

## Project Code Structure

Following screenshot shows the structure of the project we will create.

A few details:
- SpringBootTutorialBasicsApplication.java - The Spring Boot Application class generated with Spring Initializer. This class acts as the launching point for application.
- `pom.xml` - Contains all the dependencies needed to build this project. We will use Spring Boot Starter AOP.


## Tools you will need
- Maven 3.0+ is your build tool
- Your favorite IDE. We use IntelliJ, Eclipse.
- JDK 17+

Some theory

## Bootstrapping with Spring Initializr

Creating a REST service with **Spring Initializr** is quick and efficient. In this example, we will use **Spring Web MVC** as our web framework.  
The [Spring Initializr](http://start.spring.io/) provides an excellent way to bootstrap Spring Boot projects, enabling developers to generate a fully functional application setup in just a few steps.

As illustrated in the image above, the following steps need to be performed:

- Launch **Spring Initializr** and configure the project:
    - Set **Group** as `TODO`
    - Set **Artifact** as `TODO`
    - Add the following dependencies:
        - Spring Web
        - Spring Boot DevTools
        - `TODO`
- Click **Generate Project** to download the starter zip.
- Import the project into your IDE (Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA):
    - `File` → `Import` → `Existing Maven Project`
- To explore and understand all the files included in this project, refer to: `TODO`


## STEP 1 : TODO


## Step N : Executing the TODO Service 

The image below demonstrates how to execute this **GET service** using **Postman**, a popular tool for testing REST APIs.

## Executing a POST Rest Service

An example request is shown below: 

```json
```

The image below demonstrates how to execute this **POST service** using **Postman**, a popular tool for testing REST APIs.  
Make sure to:
- Go to the **Body** tab and select **raw**.
- Choose **JSON** from the dropdown menu.
- Copy the above request into the request body.
