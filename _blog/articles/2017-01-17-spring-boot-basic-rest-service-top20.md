## You will learn

- **What is a REST Service?**
- **How to bootstrap a REST service application with Spring Initializr?**
- **How to create a GET REST service** for retrieving the courses that a student is registered for?
- **How to create a POST REST service** for registering a course for a student?
- **How to execute REST services using Postman?**

## Rest Services in this Guide

In this guide, we will create three services using proper URIs and HTTP methods:

- **`@GetMapping("/students/{studentId}/courses")`**  
  Retrieve all the courses a specific student has registered for.
    - **HTTP Method:** GET
    - **Example URI:** `/students/Student1/courses`

- **`@GetMapping("/students/{studentId}/courses/{courseId}")`**  
  Retrieve details of a specific course for a specific student.
    - **HTTP Method:** GET
    - **Example URI:** `/students/Student1/courses/Course1`

- **`@PostMapping("/students/{studentId}/courses")`**  
  Register a student for a new course.
    - **HTTP Method:** POST
    - **Example URI:** `/students/Student1/courses`

## Tools You Will Need

- **Maven 3.0+** â€“ Build tool for managing dependencies and building the project
- **IDE of your choice** â€“ We recommend *Eclipse* or *IntelliJ IDEA*
- **JDK 17+** â€“ Required to run the Spring Boot application

## What is REST?

REST stands for **REpresentational State Transfer**.  
It is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints for building scalable web services.  
Any service following these rules is called a **RESTful Service**.

### Key Constraints of REST

- **Clientâ€“Server**: Clear separation between the service provider (server) and the consumer (client).
- **Uniform Interface**: Resources are identified using URIs (e.g., `/students/1/courses`).
- **Stateless**: Each request is independent; the server does not store client state.
- **Cacheable**: Responses can be cached (e.g., using HTTP caching).
- **Layered System**: Clients donâ€™t need to know if they are talking directly to the server or through intermediaries (
  like caches, proxies, or load balancers).

## Richardson Maturity Model

The **Richardson Maturity Model (RMM)** helps identify how mature a RESTful Web Service is, based on how well it follows
REST principles.  
It defines four levels (0â€“3):

- **Level 0: The Swamp of POX**
    - REST in name only â€” action-based URIs.
    - Example:
        - `http://server/getPosts`
        - `http://server/deletePosts`
        - `http://server/doThis`

- **Level 1: Resources**
    - Use of resource-based URIs (nouns instead of actions).
    - Still missing proper use of HTTP methods.
    - Example:
        - `http://server/accounts`
        - `http://server/accounts/10`

- **Level 2: HTTP Verbs**
    - Combine resources with proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
    - Example:
        - `GET /accounts/10` â†’ Retrieve account
        - `POST /accounts` â†’ Create account
        - `PUT /accounts/10` â†’ Update account
        - `DELETE /accounts/10` â†’ Delete account
    - URIs can look like:
        - `/posts/1/comments/5`
        - `/accounts/1/friends/1`

- **Level 3: HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State)**
    - Responses include not just data, but also links to possible next actions.
    - Example (Facebook user resource):
        - Returns user details **plus links** for:
            - Recent posts
            - Recent comments
            - Friend list

## Using Appropriate Request Methods

When designing RESTful APIs, always use the correct **HTTP methods** for clarity and consistency.  
Best practices for each method:

- **GET**
    - Purpose: Retrieve data (read-only).
    - Should not update anything.
    - Should be **idempotent** (multiple identical requests return the same result).
    - Possible Response Codes:
        - `200 OK` â†’ Success
        - `404 Not Found` â†’ Resource not found
        - `400 Bad Request` â†’ Invalid request

- **POST**
    - Purpose: Create a **new resource**.
    - Response should ideally include JSON with a link to the newly created resource.
    - Possible Response Codes:
        - `200 OK` â†’ Success (less common)
        - `201 Created` â†’ Resource successfully created
        - `400 Bad Request` â†’ Invalid input

- **PUT**
    - Purpose: Update an **existing known resource**.
    - Example: Update client details.
    - Possible Response Codes:
        - `200 OK` â†’ Successfully updated
        - `404 Not Found` â†’ Resource not found

- **DELETE**
    - Purpose: Delete a resource.
    - Possible Response Codes:
        - `200 OK` â†’ Successfully deleted
        - `404 Not Found` â†’ Resource not found

## Project Structure

The following screenshot shows the structure of the project we will create:

![Image](/images/SpringBootRestService-ProjectStructure.png 'Spring Boot Rest Service - Project Structure')

### A Few Details

- **`StudentController.java`** â€“ REST controller exposing the three service methods discussed earlier.
- **`Course.java`, `Student.java`, `StudentService.java`** â€“ Business logic for the application. `StudentService`
  provides methods consumed by the REST controller.
- **`StudentControllerIT.java`** â€“ Integration tests for the REST services.
- **`StudentControllerTest.java`** â€“ Unit tests for the REST services.
- **`StudentServicesApplication.java`** â€“ Launcher for the Spring Boot application. Run this file as a Java Application
  to start the service.
- **`pom.xml`** â€“ Maven build file containing all dependencies. We use **Spring Boot Starter Web** here.

## Bootstrapping Spring Boot REST API with Spring Initializr

Creating a REST service with **Spring Initializr** is very simple.  
We will use **Spring Web MVC** as our web framework.

[Spring Initializr](http://start.spring.io/) is a great tool to quickly bootstrap your Spring Boot projects.

![Image](/images/Spring-Initializr-Web.png 'Web, Actuator and Developer Tools')

As shown in the image above, follow these steps:

- Launch **Spring Initializr** and choose the following:
    - **Group**: `com.in28minutes.springboot`
    - **Artifact**: `student-services`
    - **Dependencies**:
        - Spring Web
        - Spring Boot Actuator
        - Spring Boot DevTools
- Click **Generate Project**.
- Import the project into **Eclipse**:  
  `File -> Import -> Existing Maven Project`

## Implementing Business Service for Your Application

Every application needs data. Instead of connecting to a real database, we will use an `ArrayList` as an **in-memory
data store**.

### Domain Model

- A **Student** can register for multiple **Courses**.
- A **Course** has:
    - `id`
    - `name`
    - `description`
    - a list of steps to complete the course
- A **Student** has:
    - `id`
    - `name`
    - `description`
    - a list of courses they are currently registered for

### StudentService Methods

The `StudentService` provides the following methods:

- `public List<Student> retrieveAllStudents()` â†’ Retrieve details of all students
- `public Student retrieveStudent(String studentId)` â†’ Retrieve details of a specific student
- `public List<Course> retrieveCourses(String studentId)` â†’ Retrieve all courses for a student
- `public Course retrieveCourse(String studentId, String courseId)` â†’ Retrieve details of a specific course for a
  student
- `public Course addCourse(String studentId, Course course)` â†’ Add a new course for a student

### Reference Implementation

Check the exact implementation of the `StudentService` and model classes in the following files:

- `src/main/java/com/in28minutes/springboot/model/Course.java`
- `src/main/java/com/in28minutes/springboot/model/Student.java`
- `src/main/java/com/in28minutes/springboot/service/StudentService.java`

## Adding a Couple of GET REST Services

The `StudentController` exposes two GET services:

```java
private final StudentService studentService;

public StudentController(StudentService studentService) {
    this.studentService = studentService;
}
```  

- Uses Spring **Dependency Injection** to wire the `StudentService` into the controller.

- `@GetMapping("/students/{studentId}/courses")`  
  Exposes a GET service to retrieve all courses for a given student, where `studentId` is provided as a path variable.

- `@GetMapping("/students/{studentId}/courses/{courseId}")`  
  Exposes a GET service to retrieve details of a **specific course** for a given student.

- `@PathVariable String studentId`  
  The `studentId` from the URI is automatically mapped to this parameter in the controller method.

```java
package com.in28minutes.springboot.controller;

import com.in28minutes.springboot.model.Course;
import com.in28minutes.springboot.service.StudentService;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;
import org.springframework.web.servlet.support.ServletUriComponentsBuilder;

import java.net.URI;
import java.util.List;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/students/{studentId}/courses")
public class StudentController {

    private final StudentService studentService;

    public StudentController(StudentService studentService) {
        this.studentService = studentService;
    }

    @GetMapping()
    public List<Course> retrieveCoursesForStudent(@PathVariable String studentId) {
        return studentService.retrieveCourses(studentId);
    }

    @GetMapping("/{courseId}")
    public Course retrieveDetailsForCourse(
            @PathVariable String studentId,
            @PathVariable String courseId) {

        return studentService.retrieveCourse(studentId, courseId);
    }
}
```

## Executing the Http Get Operation Using Postman

We will access a request to http://localhost:8080/students/Student1/courses/Course1 to test the service. And will
receive the following response shown in the below.

```json
{
  "id": "Course1",
  "name": "Spring",
  "description": "10 Steps",
  "steps": [
    "Learn Maven",
    "Import Project",
    "First Example",
    "Second Example"
  ]
}
```

The screenshot below shows how you can execute this **GET service** in **Postman** â€” my favorite tool for testing REST
APIs.

![Image](/images/ExecutingGetRestServiceUsingPostman.png 'Executing Rest Service From Postman')

## Adding an HTTP POST Operation REST Service

An **HTTP POST** operation should return a **201 (Created)** status when the resource is successfully created.

Key elements in our implementation:

- `@PostMapping("/students/{studentId}/courses")`  
  Maps the URI for handling **POST requests**.

- `@RequestBody Course newCourse`  
  Binds the request body to a `Course` object.

- `ResponseEntity.created(location).build()`  
  Returns a **201 Created** response along with the **Location** header pointing to the newly created resource.

```java

@PostMapping()
public ResponseEntity<Void> registerStudentForCourse(@PathVariable String studentId,
        @RequestBody Course newCourse) {

    var course = studentService.addCourse(studentId, newCourse);

    if (course == null)
        return ResponseEntity.noContent().build();

    URI location = ServletUriComponentsBuilder.fromCurrentRequest()
            .path("/{id}")
            .buildAndExpand(course.id())
            .toUri();

    return ResponseEntity.created(location)
            .build();
}

```

## Executing a Http POST Operation Rest Service

The example request below demonstrates how to register a new course for a student.  
It includes all the required course details in the request body.

```json
{
  "name": "Microservices",
  "description": "10 Steps",
  "steps": [
    "Learn How to Break Things Up",
    "Automate the hell out of everything",
    "Have fun"
  ]
}
```

The screenshot below shows how to execute this **POST operation** in **Postman** â€” my favorite tool for testing REST
services.

Make sure to:

- Go to the **Body** tab.
- Select **raw**.
- Choose **JSON** from the dropdown.
- Copy the request JSON (shown above) into the body.

The URL we use is http://localhost:8080/students/Student1/courses.
